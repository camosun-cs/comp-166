		<h2>Task 2: Hello World!</h2>
		<ol class="instructions">
			<li>Create a <samp>comp-166</samp> folder somewhere you'll be able to find it later.</li>
			<li>
				<p>Download the <samp>hello_world.c</samp> source code below, and move it into your comp-166 folder.</p>
				<a class="sample language-c" href="hello_world.c" download>Download hello_world.c</a>
				<p>Don't worry about understanding all of this code for now; we'll be learning about each piece later!</p>
			</li>
			<li>Open the folder in VSCode, and use the Explorer pane to open hello_world.c</li>
			<li>Admire the pretty syntax coloring! If it's not working for you, check that you've finished everything in Task 1 or ask for help.</li>
			<li>
				<p>The red squiggly underlines in our code (and red text in the Explorer pane) are indicating that this source file has an error. We cannot compile or run our code until all errors are fixed (yellow underlines will appear for <em>warnings</em> that indicate potential problems but won't prevent your code from compiling and running). Hover your mouse over the underlined code or open the Problems panel (<samp>View &gt; Problems</samp> in the main menu) to find out what's wrong.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>What does this error mean!?</summary>
					<p>The error messages you get from the compiler can be quite cryptic, especially when you're just starting to program. They tend to be fairly short and use a lot of specialized jargon.</p>
					<p>Do not depair! You will learn what a lot of this jargon means throughout this course, and as you get more experienced, just knowing <em>where</em> the error occurs can often be enough for you to spot the problem.</p>
					<p>In the meantime, the most common errors you will see when you are just beginning will be:</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>expected …</dt>
						<dt>syntax error before …</dt>
						<dd>Something is wrong with your syntax. Check for missing semi-colons and braces.</dd>

						<dt>identifier … is undefined</dt>
						<dd>You probably misspelled something, or forgot to use quotes. This can also happen if you've forgotten to define a variable before using it.</dd>

						<dt>undefined symbols … linker command failed</dt>
						<dd>You've either misspelled a function name (case matters!) or forgot to <code>#include</code> the header where it is defined.</dd>
					</dl>
					<p>If you're stumped, ask for help during a lab session or post a question on the course forum!</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>Fix the error by removing the line that says <samp>"Oops!"</samp> (line 4), and save your changes.</li>
			<li>Open the terminal panel (<kbd>ctrl-`</kbd>).</li>
			<li>
				<p>Type <kbd>gcc hello_world.c</kbd> and press enter</p>
				<p>If all went well, there should be no errors or warnings reported, and a new <samp>a.out</samp> file will appear in the Explorer panel. If not, ask for help!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Type <kbd>./a.out</kbd> in the terminal and press enter.</p>
				<p>You should see the words "<samp>Hello world!</samp>" appear just below your command. Congratulations, you've just compiled and run your first C program!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Extend the hello_world program to also output:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Your full name</li>
					<li>The reason you're taking this course</li>
					<li>Two or three things you hope to learn in this class</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Compile and run your code each time you make a change to make sure it still works as expected.</li>

		<h2>Task 3: Keeping it Organized</h2>
		<p>That <samp>comp-166</samp> is going to get messy quickly if we just dump everything in there for every lab. Let's make some sub-folders to keep it organized, and setup VSCode to do some of the grunt work for us.</p>
		<ol class="instructions">
			<li>Create a folder inside of comp-166 named like <samp>LastnameFirstname_lab0</samp> and move your source code into it.</li>
			<li>Optionally, create additional folders for future labs 1–6.</li>
			<li>
				<p>Now that your code is in a folder, it's a little more tedious to compile it from the terminal. You'd have to type:</p>
				<pre><code class="language-sh">gcc LastnameFirstname_lab0/hello_world.c</code></pre>
				<p>Fortunately, VSCode can do this for us!</p>
				<p>Choose <samp>Terminal > Configure Default Build Task…</samp> from the main menu (and press enter if asked to choose which tool to use).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>You should now be looking at a <samp>tasks.json</samp> file that VSCode has generated for you. We'll need to modify this file slightly so that VSCode doesn't output the program in the same folder as the source. We'll add a little more error checking at the same time.</p>
				<p>There should be section of this file that currently looks like this:</p>
				<pre><code class="language-json">
					"args": [
						"-g",
						"${file}",
						"-o",
						"${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}"
					],
				</code></pre>
				<p>Change that section to read:</p>
				<pre><code class="language-json">
					"args": [
						<ins>"-Wall",
						"-Wextra",
						"-Wpedantic",
						"-std=c99",</ins>
						"-g",
						"${file}",
						"-o",
						<span class="changed">"${fileBasenameNoExtension}"</span>
					],
				</code></pre>
				<p>and save your changes.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Switch back to your <samp>hello_world.c</samp> file and test that the build works by choosing <samp>Terminal > Run Build Task…</samp> from the main menu.</p>
				<p>Notice that a new file (or two) has appeared in the Explorer pane. With this configuration, VSCode will create an executable with the same name as your source file, instead of the default "a.out" we got in Task 2.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Open the terminal and test that you can run your program. Eg:</p>
				<pre><code class="language-sh">./hello_world</code></pre>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</section>

	<section id="task4">
		<h2>Task 4: ZIP and Submit</h2>
		<p>Create a ZIP archive of your lab0 folder, <em>including the folder itself</em>. Make sure that it includes your <samp>hello_world.c</samp> source code and <em>does not include</em> any compiled programs.</p>
		<p>To create a ZIP file on MacOS:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Open the Finder application</li>
			<li>Navigate to your <samp>comp-166</samp> folder</li>
			<li>Right-click (or control-click) your lab0 sub-folder</li>
			<li>Choose <samp>Compress "…"</samp> from the context menu</li>
		</ol>
		<p>To create a ZIP file on Windows:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Open a File Explorer window</li>
			<li>Navigate to your <samp>comp-166</samp> folder</li>
			<li>Right-click your lab0 sub-folder</li>
			<li>Choose <samp>Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder</samp> from the context menu</li>
			<li>Type a name for the new ZIP file and press enter to accept</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Submit your ZIP file to the Lab-0 assignment in D2L.</p>
		<p>All future labs will be submitted in the same way, but will not include a separate task and instructions for this process!</p>
	</section>

	<section id="submission">
		<h2>Submission and Grading</h2>
		<p>
			Completing all tasks in this lab should result in a directory with settings and folders for every lab to come in this course. <strong>Do not submit your entire workspace.</strong> Create a ZIP archive containing only your Lab-0 folder (named like <samp>LastnameFirstname_lab0</samp>) containing your hello_world.c program. Compress the folder into a ZIP archive and upload it to the D2L assignment.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>NOTE</b>: This assignment is to be done <em>individually</em>. You can help one another with problems and questions, but in the end everyone must write and submit their own code.
